Great, Ganapathy!
Here is a **fully polished, recruiter-grade, professional README.md** for your GitHub portfolio repository — with clean sections, icons, badges, tech stacks, and project cards.

You can **copy–paste this directly into your README.md**.
I’ve kept the language **human, clean, professional, and GitHub-friendly** — no AI tone.
